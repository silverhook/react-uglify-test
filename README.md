# Proof of Concept repo

The goal of this repository is to serve as a simple proof of concept how a JS/CSS package/repository can be equipped with license information in a way that this information will persist _in its relevant place_ even if the code is concatenated, minified or even uglified.

On the specification side, this is merely is applying [REUSE](https://reuse.software) community best practices and [SPDX](https://spdx.dev) ISO standard – specifically its [File Tags](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/file-tags/) and [Snippet Tags](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/file-tags/#h3-snippet-tags-format).

On the tooling side, this should work – _that is the PoC part!_ – with existing minifiers and uglifiers, without the need to modify your tooling.

**NB:** _All licenses and copyrigth notices in this repository are completely fictional, and serve only the purpose to show that/if they are preserved in the minified/uglified output._

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
